<h2><strong>Account and commenting help</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: I have forgotten my password for my Guardian registration account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To reset your password please follow <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/reset" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">this link</a>. You will receive an email with further instructions. Do check your spam folder if it doesn’t arrive in your inbox.</p>
<p>Please note, this email should arrive within a few seconds. If it does not, then it could be because your email provider quarantines automated emails to scan for viruses for a short period before sending them to you, in which case you will need to contact your IT team or email provider. If the registration email does not arrive at all, the most likely reason is that the email address that you have entered is not registered on our system.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to change my username.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You will be able to change your username if you see an option to do so at <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/public/edit" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">this link</a>. You can change your username name once. So please think carefully before creating your username. Also, at this time it is not possible to change usernames for GuardianWitness profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to change my email address.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Go to <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/account/edit" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">this link</a> and sign in if you’ve not already done so. Amend the email address and press ‘Save changes’ at the bottom of the page. An email with the subject line ‘Please confirm your email address change’ will be sent to the new email address. Select the ‘Click to Confirm’ link within the email to confirm the change. You should be taken to a page with the heading ‘Success! Your email address has been updated’.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to change my registered email address/postal address/other personal details.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Please follow <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/account/edit" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">this link</a> and sign in if you’ve not already done so, amend the details and press ‘Save changes’ at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to unsubscribe from emails.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> All of our email services have an ‘unsubscribe’ link at the end of the email. Clicking this will provide an option to unsubscribe from the particular email or unsubscribe from all emails. It should be noted that Guardian Jobs emails and Guardian newsletters are sent from different systems, as a result, you can unsubscribe from all in one system and still receive emails from the other. Should this happen, you can just use the unsubscribe link on the other email service.</p>
<p>If you have a registration account, you can adjust your newsletter preferences by following <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/email-prefs" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Should this fail to stop the emails, please contact us here at user support (the address is at the bottom of this page) for newsletters or the <a href="https://jobs.theguardian.com/contact-us/" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Jobs Help team</a> for job alerts and attach one of the unwanted emails including the header so we can investigate.</p>
